// You're working on a "Todo List" web app and your task is to output a list of dummy todo items dynamically.
// For this task, a Todo component has been prepared for you, though you must still add some code to it to
// receive and output the todo text.

// To be more precise: In the App component, you should transform the DUMMY_TODOS array that's
// provided to you (which must not be changed!) to a list of JSX elements (<Todo> elements to be precise).
// Every Todo component item must receive and output the todo text via a prop called text.

import React from 'react';

import Todo from './components/Todo.jsx';
import { DUMMY_TODOS } from './dummyData.js';

// don't change the Component name "App"
export default function App() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {DUMMY_TODOS.map((todo) => <Todo key={todo} text={todo} />)}
    </ul>
  );
}
